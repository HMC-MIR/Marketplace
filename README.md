# Marketplace Fingerprinting

This repository contains the code for our article "Large-Scale Multimodal Piano Music Identification Using Marketplace Fingerprinting."

We propose a unified method for four different sheet music retrieval tasks.  We frame the retrieval problem as a type of economics scenario involving a buyer and a seller, and our proposed method corresponds to an efficient marketplace.

To run the n-gram and dynamic n-gram baselines, please see [this repository](https://github.com/HMC-MIR/NGramBaselines).
